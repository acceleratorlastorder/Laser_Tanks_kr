# Laser_Tanks_kr
This version is a fork of the Laser Tanks Updated mod from coolfarmer

Which is itself an updated version of the original Laser Tanks mod made by OwnlyMe

The only thing i did was :
- making the mod accept Krastorio2 equipment
- making the changelog compatible with factorio parser
- translating few bit in French
